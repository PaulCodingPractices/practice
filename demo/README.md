# Elevator Management System (not functional )

## Introduction
The Elevator Management System is a Spring Boot application designed to manage elevators in a building efficiently. The application handles elevator requests, manages the movement of elevators, and ensures optimal allocation of elevators to users. The system includes features such as user authentication, handling multiple requests, and managing elevator capacities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven
- MySQL database

## Configure MySQL Database
- Create a database named 'elevator_system'
- Update 'application.properties' with your MySQL username and password
- Run the app

## Using the application
- Access the application at http://localhost:8080
- Default login credentials:
Username: admin
Password: admin
- The methods you see are the methods currently available

## Addressing Existing Errors
- The code for the task itself is ready, sadly the process of user interaction is in light words non existent
- lack of css 
- serious lacking in handling more complex situations, algorithm is much too simple for that, 
- need of some frontend logic, probably left for the last
- potential addition of non relational database , for showcase purposes
- created a more modularised version
- together the issues with the resources already implemented should take no longer than 3 days

For the person receiving this , the program itself on 28th of June is not really worth trying , the problem lays in me getting used to spring and java enviroment after year of working with Ruby on rails and writing sollutions for smaller scopes.
